# Odin Recursion

A small JavaScript project built as part of **The Odin Project** curriculum to practice **recursion**, **problem decomposition**, and **algorithmic thinking**.  
The project focuses on implementing the **Fibonacci sequence** and **Merge Sort**, both iteratively and recursively, to develop a deeper understanding of how recursive solutions work under the hood.

---

## 🧩 Project Description

This project involves implementing:

-   **Fibonacci sequence generation**
    -   Iterative approach
    -   Recursive approach
-   **Merge Sort algorithm**
    -   Fully recursive divide-and-conquer implementation

The goal is not performance optimization, but rather to clearly understand **how recursion works**, how problems can be broken down into smaller subproblems, and how recursive calls resolve and combine results.

---

## 🚀 Features

-   Recursive and iterative Fibonacci implementations for comparison
-   Recursive Merge Sort using divide-and-conquer
-   Clean, readable JavaScript focused on clarity over cleverness
-   Console-based output for easy testing and verification

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Practiced

-   Recursive function design
-   Base cases vs recursive cases
-   Call stack behavior
-   Divide-and-conquer algorithms
-   Comparing iterative vs recursive approaches
-   Writing predictable, testable functions

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

This project was built to gain hands-on experience with:

-   Thinking recursively rather than imperatively
-   Structuring recursive solutions clearly and correctly
-   Understanding time complexity tradeoffs in recursive algorithms
-   Implementing classic computer science algorithms from scratch
-   Reading and reasoning about recursive code

## 🧪 Example Usage

```js
fibs(8);
fibsRec(8);
// → [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]

mergeSort([5, 3, 8, 4, 2]);
// → [2, 3, 4, 5, 8]
```
